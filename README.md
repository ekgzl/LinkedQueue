# Queue Implementation in C++

This repository contains a simple implementation of a queue data structure in C++.

## Overview

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are inserted at the rear and deleted from the front.

## Implementation Details

### Files

- `Queue.h`: Header file containing the definition of the Queue class and its methods.
- `main.cpp`: Main program demonstrating the usage of the Queue class.

### Compilation

To compile the program, use any C++ compiler such as g++:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o queue
